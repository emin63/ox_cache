The OxCacheFullKey class is a namedtuple to represent a cache key with
the following components:

  - namespace:  The namespace the key lives in.
  - base_key:   The `key` value provided in something like `store` or `get`.
  - opts:       A list of pairs representing the **opts provided to something
                like `store` or `get`.

We use a compose key like this since sometimes it useful to distinguish
the base key from the opts and have both readily available.

While the value of having a namespace in the cache as separate from the key
may be straightforward, you might wonder why we need the opts. Roughly
speaking, these make our implemetnation much more flexible for sub-classes.
For example, they allow a relatively simple implementation of function
memoization as with the OxMemoizer or TimedMemoizer classes.

        where the key came from if you like.

        Note that generally you can just pass an instance of OxCacheFullKey

        the pieces of the key.

class OxCacheBase:
    """Base class for caches.

This serve as the base class providing most of the caching functionality
such as locking, checking expiration, and so on. Some of the functions
you may wish to override include:

  - make_value:      Make a value for a requested key not in the cache.
  - ttl_for_record:  Determine time to live for a given cache record.
  - create_ttl:      Create initial time-to-live for record when created.

In order to create a cache, the bare the minimum you need to do is to
override the `make_value` method as illustrated below.

>>> from ox_cache import OxCacheBase
>>> class NeverExipiringCache(OxCacheBase):
...     'Simple cache which never expires'
...     def make_value(self, key, **opts):
...         'Simple function to create value for requested key.'
...         print('Calling refresh for key="%s"' % key)
...         return 'key="%s" made' % key
...
>>> cache = NeverExipiringCache()
>>> cache.get('test')  # Will refresh the cache for this key and return value
Calling refresh for key="test"
'key="test" made'
>>> cache.get('test')  # Will return cached value since already in cache
'key="test" made'
>>> cache.get('foo')   # Will refresh the cache for this key and return value
Calling refresh for key="foo"
'key="foo" made'

We can also use many of the familiar built-in features of dicts likes
len, __iter__, in, del, items, and so on. One minor issue is that the cache
keys are OxCacheFullKey instances which are combinations of the key and
the **opts provided. You can still index the cache using OxCacheFullKey
instances but you can also display just the base key if you like as shown
below.

>>> for fkey in sorted(cache): # Can iterate over cache items
...     print('%s: %s' % (fkey.base_key, cache[fkey])) # note [] instead of get
...
foo: key="foo" made
test: key="test" made
>>> cache.delete('test') # Delete item from cache
>>> len(cache), len(list(cache.items()))  # len and items also work
(1, 1)
>>> cache.get('test')  # Will refresh the cache since we deleted this key
Calling refresh for key="test"
'key="test" made'
>>> del cache["test"]
>>> 'test' in cache, 'foo' in cache  # You can use the in operator for exists
(False, True)

You can determine things like how keys are expired or removed either by
overriding methods such as ttl_for_record and create_ttl or by using some
of the mixins provided. See `help(ox_cache)` for `print(ox_cache.__doc__)`
for a more detailed discussion.
