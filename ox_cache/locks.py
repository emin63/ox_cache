The TimeoutLock is a custom version of threading.Lock which will autoamtically
timeout and raise an Exception if it cannot acquire a lock. This is helpful
since if you are waiting on a lock for a long time, probably it is a deadlock
and you want to be informed.

The following illustrates example usage:

>>> from ox_cache import locks
>>> lock = locks.TimeoutLock(timeout=2)
>>> try:
...     with lock:
...         print('this should get printed fine')
...         with lock:
...             print('this should cause a timeout')
... except Exception as problem:
...     print('got problem: %s' % str(problem))
...
this should get printed fine
got problem: Unable to get lock after timeout of 2
>>> with lock:
...     print('Can reuse lock after it is released')
...
Can reuse lock after it is released
